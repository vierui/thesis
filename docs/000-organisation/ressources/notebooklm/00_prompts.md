Return :
1. Return summary of chapter 4. focus mostly on technical aspect presented. Break down concepts clearly and their mechanisms
2. focusing solely on the chapter 4 and its relationship within the general topic, return improvement axis for optimization areas on hardware optimization (it can be within memory, consumption, etc). Be technical and creative. Act as top lab AI/ML researcher.
If you find other areas for optimization , only output the ones with high confidence.

# LLM from scratch 

Return a clear and technical summary of the chapter 2 of the book LLMs from Scratch.
Break down each subchapter in detail and focus on the key knowledge points.

# LLM Agents -- CS 194/294-196
## 1. Class Summary
Generate a technical summary of the class. Break down concepts clearly and think in systems and their mechanisms.
## 2. Agent Design for Efficiency
Identify principles and structures that enable **efficient agent operation** that are highlighted  in the class
### 2.1 Architecture & Reasoning
if mentionned :
- Outline the agent’s loop and note where **efficiency can be optimized**.
- Explain reasoning shortcuts that minimize **tokens, steps, and latency**.
- Highlight **patterns** that reduce computational overhead.
### 2.2 Systems & Best Practices
if mentionned :
- Describe how to **think in systems**: breaking tasks into minimal specialized agents to reduce total computation.
- List concrete **best practices** mentioned for hardware-efficient agent design (prompting, memory use, execution control).
## 3. Paths to Sustainable LLMs via Agents
Within that class explore how agents could actively lower computation, memory, or energy use during inference and operation. Only input highly confident findings. address the bottlenecks: e.g. Resource AreaBottleneck/ChallengeAgent's Potential Contribution (Mechanism) Inference/ComputationHigh FLOPs/long latency per query; unnecessary large model activation.

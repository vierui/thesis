Date : 25-07-08
Participants : Prof. Chou, Prof Czerner, Rui
Remarks : Online, 
#### Task : Define interests / Research Further for topic 3. LLMs
---

Notes:
1. smart microgrid : prepare the system / distribution most important part (Before), Renewable energy, unpredictable (solar and wind) but the most common, if too big it's wasted -Y
- EV charging -> Current capacity power grid not possible other (Taiwan ask to get in a line to charge . But costly) -> But also good to manage in facilities with the power company -> how to ship the charging to the 
- storage structure -> Carbon reduction goal but minimize the unit of the energy cost keh. 
- smart meter in tawain -> Electricity price varies in Taiwan. 


1. ARMFS Robotics mobiles for .... : Order picking. KEVA system : instead of picker -> the the small robot take rack to the picking station (PAT). -> Issue : how do we shelf, which order to which picking stations ? Optimization (replenishment) rooting problems -> Reduce energy consumption. 
   Each part of the (3parts) Reinforcement Learning for to avoid traffic congestion. 


2. LLMs w/ CS students.
- explain German student with quantification optimization on on LLMs. 
- exemple 2 : retrieve technical RAG with LLM with Goggles, 
- greenwashing detection 


4. problem to solve : how do we capture information sufficiently -> How (audio summary, video (what ), user perspective (some people like to read, some people - different stages of learning require different outputs) -> Mentorship -> Hope to narrow the timespan the -> Transfert the knowledge more efficiently (work project assessing esg reports) @Maurice
- student summer : data/ cs (internship) students understanding tools,

### 1-1 meeting 
Goal : 1st in-person-meeting, presentation more in detail of the current research about the llms - alignement with interests of lab / Rui 
Date : 25-09-26
Participants : Prof. Chou, Rui
Remarks : MA217 (NTUST -- Prof Chou's office), 
#### Task : Define interests define alignement for thesis - guidelines

Notes : 

About LLMs
1. Simplifying language / inference
2. Nobel LM (google) -> by providing a paper : agent + pro (evaluating outcome Nobel lm -> search for paper ) evaluate on text - conversational - audio
3. 
4. 
How moo make more useful. Cognitive 

Hardware reduction 
Running or quantization. : comparation 

Fine tunning ? Based on chatgpt how to improve based on which metric.

Geopolitical note (personal interest) : Former minister Indonesia (luhud) ???

——
Multi agent platform not well balancing -> too many platforms -> for picking platform or e-commerce (not global optimzation) local were made within simulation -> local optimization selection / assignment (w/ RL)


Focus on rich areas (llms, energy)


Ai can perform better than all genius 


Rag to create semantic 

- Knowledge transfer in companies  (know-how)

### students meeting 
- present topic to prof Chou on Oct 22 to 

# 08.10.2025
### students meeting 
*no remarks*

### citi meeting (w/ Prof) 
#### general remarks
- repeat of basics ??? 
- when presenting other people work / paper : source paper quality and provenance. (How good the research is - reputation journal) 

#### brian
- too vague -> requires solid benchmarking 
- requires a process validation more solid. 

- understand all the components interacting w/ the system is first required and then we define an axis 

- focus on knowledge transfer (within the knowledge) -> effectiveness on transferring to knowledge to people. "Do we have this knowledge already ?"

- define clear: what content we want to transfer and address the issues.
- goal is to identify area where effectiveness of the knowledge transfer can be achieved (!!)
- knowledge transfer requires understanding the overall problem before transferring it. (Practice, muscle memory for swim, but here waht kind of knowledge do we want to transfer)
	- depends on the area of application

- the system should be able to clarify with the person its understand -> assess the understanding of the person. (Able to query the user) -> System should be able to test AND guide. FUNCTION REQUIRED.

- aim for accuracy of inference and lower hallucinations 

- well known publications are llm are doing quite different (?) -> In the process

#### Fadhil-Zhafran-Isaqh
##### präzi-notes
- knowledge type -> REQUIRED
- so much time lost in thesis selection (1 semester ?)

- knowledge sources : No output work tracking ? daily-Task tracking ? Screen Monitoring review ? Workmate/interaction links? Personnal folder structure analysis ? 
- current Task automation process? How do optimize it ? Can't we break down the same for output work ? 

- knowledge transfer issues : incentive sharing, technology barriers, cultural Barriers. 

- skill matrix ? Breakdown skills ? -> Knowledge obtained from skills ? 

- Issue1: lack mechanisms fro incremental knowledge (need retraining while feeding / new knowledge). problem to solve :
	- tacit knowledge understanding improvement 
	- rag implementation for rag continual learning
	- multimodal prompt integration

- Issue2: poor interpretability and reasoning 

	- how knowledges are created :
	1. existing document
	2. Reading chatbot history
	3. Personnel notes
	4. Bots that collect "important knowledge" HOW ???
	5. Meeting transcripts and recordings

- issue4: converting knowledge
 Similarities from one doc to other via embedding and graph retrieval

- issue5: retrieving the knowledge

The will integrate the meeting transcript + 2 thesis.
##### remarks from prof Chou 
- this knowledge type overview is important and important (p4)
- we need to know on which knowledge we are focusing on to know where and what to retranscribe or where to source -> Based on knowledge types. Reason for what and what search is required (process rigorous is required)

- *clear issue* with outdated knowledge -> How to "update" the knowledge  w/o retraining completely ? How do we know is outdated ? How do we know it's valid knowledge? Procedure /mechanism to know it's valid (system may help us to know that!) / interactive process required

- knowledge classification and organization makes it more logic -> more efficient. (Metadata required) -> the llm should classify it for us. 
(Graph may help ?) -> Requires auto classification / labels assignation.

- fathom.ai/ or otter.ai for meeting recordings.

- what to bring something new ! Making contribution to "research" requires novelty and utility

- (p17) chou wants a top view level ; what is being done 
-> ask gemini to do a high level research on it. 
- How human and AI should work together system -> we need to intervein to keep thinking. We want the ai to be a skeleton but help us in the thinking system. Should be able to use it efficiently. To enhance our ability. (Futur topic)

- emphasis on other people -> Mention /reference properly !!!

#### ai companion - zoom 
Several issues were discussed in the meeting:

Knowledge management and transfer problems, particularly how to capture and transfer tacit knowledge
Issues with outdated knowledge and how to ensure knowledge is up-to-date
The need for classification and organization of knowledge, even with LLM-based systems
How to create and use graph RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to identify relationships between knowledge pieces
The importance of automated processes for knowledge classification

Difficulties in applying knowledge and bridging knowledge to action
The need for feedback loops in knowledge management systems
Problems with information overload and contextual information
The challenge of capturing tacit knowledge that exists in people's experiences

The discussion also emphasized the need to develop a system that not only passively answers questions but can actively verify users' understanding and guide their learning process.


# 15.10.2025
## Topics presentation 
Alignment of the topic **w/ prof Chou** for the future of the thesis.
presented : [[ntust-thesis-proposal]]
## Decision - to do next
Keep searching on the agent use within llms with the goal to reduce hardware size / energy consumption. 
Emphasis on : smart  -  sustainable agents  -  edge hardware  -  flexibility  -  
Example use case : 

## remarks and notes
flexibility about the layers -> many agents running on many devices, Hanover (IPA)-> working with manufacturing system low energy consumption Agents (Administration shell language -> reference architecture industry 4.0  - RAMI4.0) based on the same interface to get a smart agent not (use case) becaude running on the same layer. 

Agent -> consumption -> make it an agent smarte and light but keep 
Use case (think of german) 

---
Report with a goal with new methods in new areas 
show improvement from A to B 
Efficiency - get i done and self contained with novelty ->
Self reflection is important - trust and importance

## Brian presentation's 
comments from prof chou : 
- base your work on existent frameworks - do not reinvent the wheel 

## Wendy's presentation 
implementation : 
- uncertainty-aware retrieval : quantifying certainy based on the semantic entropy of responses 
  (semantic -> relation to meaning)

## Summary - key points
1. Brian Nguyen presented his methodology for testing user interactions with podcasts:
    - He outlined 3 hypotheses comparing different media formats (text, conversational podcasts, non-conversational podcasts, and podcasts with visual elements)
    - His testing will measure cognitive load, germane load, perceived usefulness, ease of use, and knowledge transfer
    - He plans to use 30-45 participants for his experiment

2. Wendy presented her research on semantic entropy:
    - She proposes adding two new mechanisms to the LKC system: uncertainty detection based on semantic entropy and interactive question planning
    - Semantic entropy measures how uncertain or confused a language model is by looking at the meaning behind tokens
    - Her framework would be placed after retrieval ranking but before final response generation

3. Professor Shuo-Yan Chou provided feedback to both presenters:
    - He advised Brian to clearly identify how his research differs from previous work on conversational podcasts
    - For Wendy, he questioned how effectively semantic entropy could be controlled and suggested considering user characteristics
    - He recommended both students consult with other researchers for further guidance

## citi meeting (w/ Prof) 

### Avi
check how to map related work how she did it 
MEntion what we bring 


-> search for the gap : emphasis on the quality of the papers - relevance ! Which are more important. How good are the papers journal ranking, check citations too, feelings/guts : good bad ?, checked for peer reviewed.

-> identify the key differences in OUR ideas 
-> explain why in presentation

# 21.10.25
**Meeting chit-chat**
w/ : Olivier D'Ancona (olivier.dancona@hefr.ch)

**Goal**
exchange

**Notes** 
Olivier is doing a phd about rag implementation for the HES-SO
- optic of the thesis 
	- **research** -> study and global evaluation of the klm 
		e.g does it make more sense having a wiki than paying for rag host etc ?
		global evalution -> 
		- Why is it better than a simple gpt ?
		- rag components ? vectorization ?
		- global infra costs ?
		- ...
	- **engineering**  -> solution to improve the computational ressources
		- evaluated on metrics and comparison
- llms is not point of the work. the work relies on how the architecture with the rag is improved and stacked.

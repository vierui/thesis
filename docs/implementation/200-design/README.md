# 200-design | Architecture & Method Definition

## Phase Information
**Timeline:** November 1-30, 2025
**Gantt Phase:** Design
**Status:** Not Started

## Objectives
- Define baseline system (LLM stack, dataset, metrics)
- Design agentic process concept:
  - Adaptive model selection
  - Recursive micro-model reasoning
  - Context-aware caching / modular execution
- Draft architecture: local agent orchestrator + lightweight inference engine
- Specify measurement methodology and efficiency metrics

## Implementation Log

### 2025-10-XX | System Architecture Specification (201)
**What:** Initial system architecture draft based on CITI KMS analysis

**Why:** Define target system structure before implementation begins

**How:** Analyzed CITI architecture, identified optimization opportunities, designed agent integration points

**Results:** [To be completed during Nov phase]

**Links:** [201-system-architecture.md](./201-system-architecture.md)

### 2025-10-XX | Efficiency Metrics Framework (202)
**What:** Comprehensive framework for measuring computational efficiency and performance

**Why:** Need quantitative metrics to evaluate optimization impact

**How:** Defined CPU/GPU/memory/storage/network metrics, pipeline performance indicators, energy consumption measurements

**Results:** [To be completed during Nov phase]

**Links:** [202-efficiency-metrics.md](./202-efficiency-metrics.md)

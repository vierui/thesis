# 100-literature | Literature Review

## Phase Information
**Timeline:** October 15-31, 2025
**Gantt Phase:** Literature Review
**Status:** In Progress

## Objectives
- Review quantization, pruning, caching, hardware-aware scheduling techniques
- Study agentic systems and adaptive model routing
- Analyze edge inference benchmarks (energy, latency, accuracy tradeoffs)
- Comparative study of edge LLM techniques (Phi-3, Mistral, Qwen2-1.5B)
- Establish theoretical foundations for knowledge management systems

## Implementation Log

### 2025-10-XX | Knowledge Management Foundations (101)
**What:** Literature review on knowledge management theory and organizational knowledge transfer

**Why:** Understanding theoretical foundations of KMS before analyzing CITI implementation

**How:** Reviewed Polanyi (tacit vs explicit knowledge), Nonaka & Takeuchi (SECI model), Davenport & Prusak, Alavi & Leidner, DIKW pyramid

**Results:** Established theoretical framework for understanding knowledge types, transfer mechanisms, and organizational learning

**Decisions:** Focus on tacit-explicit knowledge spectrum and transfer barriers (stickiness concept)

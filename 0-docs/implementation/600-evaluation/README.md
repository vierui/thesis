# 600-evaluation | Experiments & Benchmarking

## Phase Information
**Timeline:** February 1-28, 2026
**Gantt Phase:** Evaluation - Experiments & Benchmarks
**Status:** Not Started

## Objectives
- Design comprehensive evaluation experiments
- Compare baseline vs. agentic optimization configurations
- Compare quantized vs. full-precision models
- Measure metrics:
  - Energy efficiency (J/inference, W load)
  - Latency and throughput
  - Accuracy/response quality
  - Flexibility and scalability
- Statistical analysis of results

## Implementation Log

_No entries yet. Work begins February 2026._

## Phase-Specific Research
See [`research/`](./research/) subfolder for evaluation frameworks, benchmarking methodologies, and statistical analysis techniques.

## Dependencies
**Requires:** [500-integration](../500-integration/) - Integrated system ready for evaluation
**Enables:** [700-analysis](../700-analysis/) - Results analysis and discussion

## Deliverables
- [ ] **D4:** Experiments & metrics (Due: Feb 15)
- [ ] Experiment design document
- [ ] Benchmark results (baseline vs. optimized)
- [ ] Energy consumption measurements
- [ ] Performance comparison (latency, throughput, accuracy)
- [ ] Raw data and processed results
